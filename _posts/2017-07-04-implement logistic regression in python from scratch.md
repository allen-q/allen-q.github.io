In this post, I'm going to explain how we can build a Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm using Python from scratch. I'm also going to explain the concept of this algorithm and discuss the math involved.

First of all, what is Logistic Regression? In simple term, Logistic Regression is an extention to the [Linear Regression](https://allen-q.github.io/Implement-Linear-Regression-in-Python-From-Scratch) algorithm we have discussed earlier.
